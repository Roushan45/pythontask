Given n=1,999

x=0.5;
for i=1:n
    y=x*x+10;
    for j=i+1:n+2
        z=x*y+2.5;
        w=y*z;
    end
end

I have analyzed the above code and also run the code and got the
4003997 and its true.

first for loop start with 1 and will run upto 1999
so very first multipication will be y=x*x+10; and once second loop start
it will run from addition of 1 to value of i 
like in first loop value of i is 1 and once in nested for loop value of j will be 1 and will run until
the n+2 that is 1001 so in evry loop value of j will be get incremented by 1. and in nested loop two multipication happening
z=x*y+2.5; and w=y*z; so in first iteration value of i=1
and count of multipication will be 1 in in main for loop and 2000*2=4000 +1=4001
and in second loop value of i will be 2 and in nested loop value of j will be 3 and no of multipication
will be 1999*2=3998+1=3999 and in every loop it will get decreasing by 2 until the value of i will be 
1999 and once it will sum up it will be 4003997.


I hope you get it if not please do let me know
