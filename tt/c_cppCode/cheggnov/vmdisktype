I assumed that you using the virtualbox or VMware workstaion for virtual machine setup.
And you confuse to select the menory type for virtual machine storage if i am right then please find below the explanation:

i believe you getting two options 
    a)fixed size memory
    b)dynamic size memory

what is fixed sized memory?
Once you select the virtual machine disk as fixed size memory then virtualbox/workstaion will allocate all the memory that you 
opeted at same time in other word if u selected 10 gb for virtual machine disk then 10 gb of space will be allocated to virtual maching
instantly. This is also referred as thick disk provisioning.

what is dynamic size memory or dynamic allocation.
Once you selected the machine disk as the dynamic type then virtualbox/workstaion will allocate only that memore space that will have the actual virtual machine
size at current. in other words if u selected 10 gb for virtual machine disk then it will consume only required space not all 10 gb
at once. It will dynamically allocate the space as required. It is also referredf as thin disk provisioning.

So, you can select and type of memory for virtual machine and can perform your lab.

please do let me know if i have'nt met your expectations also add few keys that will help me to 
drive the correct answer that you looking for.

Thanks,
