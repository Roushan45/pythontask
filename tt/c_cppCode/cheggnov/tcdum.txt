for performing this make sure you have tcpdump utility installed if not then please install
on Debian platform : sudo apt install tcpdump -y
on rhel/centos : sudo yum install tcpdump -y

Make sure you have two machines running in sam network(wlan/wifi)

get the name of interface attached by command : ip a
here my server vm  connected to wifi and i have installed virtual box for Virtual machine

on the client machine also get the name of attached interface and note down the ip address also

As given in question  (Server SRV IP - 172.16.30.10) (Client CLT IP -172.16.31.10) but it might can differ
so please verify once before doing it

Q) On the server: Execute tcpdump with useful options: capture traffic on “eth1” (network card)
from/to your server, display numeric values for hosts and services (port numbers),
display ASCII output, display readable time format.

Ans : So command for this will be 
syntax: tcpdump -i <replace_with_interface>
replace the interface name with yours
in question eth1 given but it may br chage so verify it in ip a command
example : tcpdump -i wlo1 -tttt

Explain : tcpdump is installed package
-i is a option for attaching interface 
-tttt is for displaying the output in human readable format

Q)On the server: Start an nc server on port 59999.
this can be done by below command (make sure nc package installed)
nc -l 59999

Q)On the client: Connect to the nc server using an nc client.
this can be done below command here need to give the host ip address as per given question it will be
172.16.30.10 but please do verify before giving it 
nc - 172.16.30.10 59999

Q)Chat between server & client and view the messages being displayed in clear-text in your tcpdump output.
please find below the chat screenshot and tcpdump output that containg the chat text

Q)Store the tcpdump command line (not the tcpdump output) in a text file called tcpdumpMN.cli.  
so basically i have little doubts in this question . i am assuming the it asking the comand that used for 
displaying messages in tcpdump output
