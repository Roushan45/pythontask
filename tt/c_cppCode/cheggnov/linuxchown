Hi Chris,

Please find below the detailed solution.

After observing the below output
ls -l

-rwxr--r--1 cole division 0 2009 - 02 -10 04:59 bank

-rwxr--r--1 cole division 0 2010 - 01 -04 04:59 database

-rwxr--r--1 cole division 0 2010 - 09 - 17 04:59 project

-rwxr--r--1 cole division 0 2011 - 07 - 23 04:59 school

all the scripts belong to user cole and it have the 744 permission means only root and user can execute(x) the
scripts so cole i the owner of that files.

Why can't Chris run the scripts listed in this output? What command should you use to give Chris the permission needed to run them?
Ans: if Chris added in sudoers group then can run the script by using sudo command like 
sudo ./<script_name>
then it will ask the password.

first method:
User Chris can run the script the using sudo command.

second method:
IF owner of file will change to Chris then chris can run
change owner: below command need to run as sudo previlege
sudo chown Chris <script_name> 
after firing the above command user Chris will owner of that file. and can run the script without using sudo command
./<script_name>

chmod is abbreviated for change mode is used set the permission of resources.
in linux read(r) permission identified as 4
write(w) as 2 and execute(x) as 1  so total max permission will be 7.

pro of chmod and sudo:
after changing the ownership he can do whatever with file with root privelege.
no need to chage the file permission , user can run another user's file with root privelege.

con of chmod and sudo:
If possible then give as nuch less permission to user to your file because it will be potentially harmful
to give full permission.
using sudo user can use another resources which might be sensitive and not supposed to use by user.

Hope this solution will help you out.
Please do let me know if you have any concern/queries.
