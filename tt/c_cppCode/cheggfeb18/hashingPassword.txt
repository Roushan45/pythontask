What is hashing?
hashing is way to encrypt the simple text to encrypted data.
It is the one way processing means simple text can br encryted to hashed but 
encrypted password/text cannot be reversed to plain text.
It used the hashing algorithm to scramble the data  deterministic way.
For any text password hashing will produce the same hash code each time, for the same password.

Advantages of hashing password.

As per algorithm used for hashing it generates the strong hashed data.
for the same text/password it will generates the same password.
It used to store the secure data.
It is nightmare for the hacker to decrypt the password.

Disdvantages of hashing password.

Once password hashed it cannot be reversed.
Only password reset will be the option in case of password forgot.
Hash collisions can occur when different data values result in the same hash code

if hashing is used what is the most secure?

data that to be hashed will be most secure if hashing done because it cannot be reversible.
