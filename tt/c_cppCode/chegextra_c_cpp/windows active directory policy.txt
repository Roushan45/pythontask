Rule - Enforce password hitory

Policy Statement-> On changing password it should not match the previous 24 passwords of user.
		   Policy settings determines the number of unique new password associated with user
		   Account before an old password can be reused.
		   Many User in Organization wants to reuse the same password for their account, if
		   the user keep longer same password then security breacheds chances will be more.

Rule - Maximum Password Age

Policy Statement-> From time when existing user change/set password or new User account created password
		   Should be change within 42 days.Policy setting determines the period of time (in days) 
		   that a password can be used before the system requires the user to change it.
		   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule - Minimum Password Age

Policy Statement-> Configure the minimum password age to be more than 0 if you want Enforce password history to be effective.
		   Without a minimum password age, users can cycle through passwords 
		   Setting the Minimum password age to 1 it will resist user to change password frequently.
		   if you configure the Enforce password history policy setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 24 passwords,
		   but you do not configure the Minimum password age policy setting to a number that is greater than 0, users could change their
		   password 25 times in a few minutes and reuse their original password. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is
                   greater than 0 for the Enforce password history policy setting to be effective.

Rule - Minimum Password Length

Policy Statement-> On chnaging password , length of password should not be less than 7 characters.
		   If password length will be less than 7 digits then the chance of user account to be attacked
		   by the attackers will gain more. It always best practice to set policy for minimum password 
		   length more than 6 characters.

Rule - Password Complexity Requirement

Policy Statement-> The policy setting must determines the  whether passwords must meet complexity requirements. 
		   Complexity requirements are enforced when passwords are changed or created.
		   whether passwords must meet complexity requirements. Complexity requirements are enforced when passwords are changed or created.

Rule - Store passwords using reversible encryption

Policy Statement-> Enabling Store Passwords Using Reversible Encryption determines whether Windows stores passwords using reversible encryption.
		   Enabling this is essentially the same as storing passwords in plain text which is insecure and not recommended. 
		   The purpose of this policy setting is to provide support for applications that use protocols that require knowledge of 
		   the user's password for authentication purposes.The intent of this policy is to provide support for applications 
		   which use protocols that require knowledge of the user password for authentication purposes.
                   Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords. 
                   For this reason, this policy should never be enabled unless application requirements outweigh the need to protect password information.
