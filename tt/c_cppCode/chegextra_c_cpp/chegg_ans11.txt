a. Loop will execute n^2 times.

in first iteration value for i will be zero and for j it will be from 0 to n-1.

for example take n=5

1st iteration

i =0, j =0

i =0, j=1

i =0, j=2

i =0, j=3

i =0, j=4

2nd Iteration

i =1, j=0

i=1, j=1

i=1, j=2

i=1, j=3

i=1, j=4

and so on......

Complexity will be O(n^2)  

Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. 



b. Loop will execute n*2 times.

in first iteration value for i will be zero and for j it will be 0 to 2-1.


for example take n=5

1st iteration

i =0, j =0

i =0, j=1

2nd Iteration

i =1, j=0

i =1, j=1

3rd Iteration

i =2, j=0

i =2, j=1

and so on....



Complexity will be O(n^2)  although it also have nested loop

Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. 


C. Loop will execute n*(n-1) times.

in first iteration value for i will be zero and for j it will be from n-1 to 1 .


for example take n=5


1st iteration

i =0, j =4

i =0, j=3

i =0, j=2

i =0, j=1


2nd Iteration

i =1, j=4

i=1, j=3

i=1, j=2

i=1, j=1

and so on...

Complexity will be O(n^2)  although it also have nested loop

Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. 


d.for this scenario first loop will run n times j loop will run less n-1 times.

lets take example of n=5

in first iteration i=0 then j should be less than 0 so in inside loop will not execute because contidion not met.
in second loop i=1 then for inside loop j==0 then j%3 will return 0 then it will print i = 1, j=0
          now i =1 and j<i , then it will return false and exit the entire loop.

please look below for below output for n=5

  i =1  j= 0
  i =2  j= 0
  i =3  j= 0
  i =4  j= 0
  i =4  j= 3

Complexity for this also O(n2) due to nested loop
