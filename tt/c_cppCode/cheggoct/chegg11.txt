a) i=6 i<=12 i=i+1
Loops  = 7
in this case value if i incrementing by one each time and it will run until its value less than equal to 12
means i=6,7,8,9,10,11,12 so value of loops will be 7

b) i=4 i<15 i= 1+3
Loops = 5
in this case value if i incrementing by 3 after each loop
i = 4,7,10,13 so 4 will be the value

c) i=18 i<=18 i = i-1

Loops = Infinite(or until the memory overflow)
I this cases value if decrementing by one after each loop
so value of i = 18,17,16,15.....-1,-2 so on
and cindition will always true that i<=18 so all nefative numbers are less than 18

d) i=1 i>16 i=1*2
Loops = 0
condition for i>16 will return false and because value of is 1 it should be greater than 16 for executing the loop

e) i=-10 i<50 i=1-10
Loops = Infinite(or until the memory overflow)
value of i is decrementing by 10 and condition for breaking loop is i<50 and it will never false because value of i is decrementing after each loop
value of i = -10,-20,-30........so on

f)i=19 i>9 i=1-2
Loops = 5
in this scenario value of i decrementing by 2 after each loop executing
value of i = 19,17,15,13,11

g) i=14 i!=8 1=1-2
Loops = 3
in this case have different condition for exiting loop or loop will run until value of i not equal to 8
and after each loop value of i is decrementing by 2
so value if i = 14,10,12

h) i=31 i<=31 i=i+1
Loops = 1
in this case value of i incrementing by one after each loop executing.
and condition for exiting the loop is value if i should not be greater than 31
